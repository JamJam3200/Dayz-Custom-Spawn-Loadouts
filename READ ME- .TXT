Welcome To My Github, I hope you are all having a wonderful day!. 

I recently watched a video tutorial on how to set up custom spawn loadouts on your community server, and it had me thinking on what limitations are there or if there really was any to begin with. 

After a few hours of trial and error I discovered that you can have multiple different loadouts with the survivors set into separate categories. Knowing how many survivor names are currently within the files of dayz and the example spawn loadout file, what if we were to split them up and give them their own separate loadout?. 

(If you are wondering which survivor is who, you can head to the dayz wiki and find out there. I'll leave a link here if needed) Link: https://dayz.fandom.com/wiki/Survivors


Example: 
- Hunter Loadout - 

"SurvivorF_Judy",
"SurvivorM_Rolf",
"SurvivorM_Kaito",      
"SurvivorM_Lewis",
"SurvivorM_Manua",
"SurvivorM_Guo"
 

These six survivors will spawn with the hunting loadout that has been configured to be their spawn loadout and should not conflict with any set loadout as long as the survivors name hasnâ€™t been used twice in separate loadouts. This is crucial if you want certain loadouts to be on the categorized survivors otherwise it's completely fine so long as you have altered the gear sets accordingly to spawn with items. 

I have made six custom spawn loadouts set with predetermined gear and a unique way to give your players a scare upon loading onto your server. You are more than welcome to use these files for your server/ or alter them to your needs. 

I plan on making more custom loadouts, and altering the current versions that have already been made.

If you would like some custom loadouts or have any suggestions feel free to contact me here. 

Below this text file will be another readme file with the set categories and the json files accordingly.
